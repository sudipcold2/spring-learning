Annotations - Default Bean Names - The Special Case
Annotations - Default Bean Names ... and the Special Case

In general, when using Annotations, for the default bean name, Spring uses the following rule.

If the annotation's value doesn't indicate a bean name, an appropriate name will be built based on the short name of the class (with the first letter lower-cased).

For example:

HappyFortuneService --> happyFortuneService

---

However, for the special case of when BOTH the first and second characters of the class name are upper case, then the name is NOT converted.

For the case of RESTFortuneService

RESTFortuneService --> RESTFortuneService

No conversion since the first two characters are upper case.

Behind the scenes, Spring uses the Java Beans Introspector to generate the default bean name. Here's a screenshot of the documentation for the key method.

Also, here's a link to the documentation.

As always, you can give explicity names to your beans.

@Component("foo")
public class RESTFortuneService .... {
    
}

Then you can access it using the name of "foo". Nothing tricky to worry about :-)
